Seasonality

This repository is an initiative to provide analytical tools to analyze Severe Acute Respiratory Infections (SARI)
notifications registered at SINAN, the Brazilian Notifiable Diseases Information System (www.saude.gov.br/sinan).
Analyzis are performed for each Brazilian State as well as by influenza-like illnessess (ILI) regions.

This is a product of the joint work between researchers at the Scientific Computation Program at Oswaldo Cruz
Foundation (Fiocruz, PROCC), School of Applied Mathematics at Fundação Getúlio Vargas (EMAp-FGV), both from Rio de
Janeiro, Brazil, and the Inluenza Work Force at the Health Surveillance Secretariat of the Brazilian Ministry of
Health (GT-Influenza, SVS, MS).

Threshold definition is based on the Moving Epidemics Method by Jose E. Lozano (https://github.com/lozalojo/mem) with small variations by Marcelo F C Gomes (https://github.com/marfcg/mem/tree/update/candidate).
